This app is an advanced Q&A platform that allows users to upload multiple text documents and receive answers to their queries
based on the content of these documents. The app utilizes RAG framework powered by OpenAI GPT model to provide insightful and
contectually relevant answers.

#### How it works:

1. Upload a document: You can upload any text document in .txt or .pdf format.
2. Ask a Question: Type in your question pertaining to uploaded documents.
3. Get an Answer: The app analyzes the documents and provides relevant answers from the documents.

##### Get Started
Simple upload your documents and start asking questions!!
